There must be support for businesses occupying store fronts downtown. Development and maintenance of the Central Park area and seasonal decoration of business district throughout the year helps. The College shows an obvious commitment towards integration, at least physically, in the town, which helps both the town and the College. I’ve always thought that Iowans generally tend to find validation when chain restaurants and businesses take up occupancy in their communities. I think that Grinnell may have resisted that trend, or maybe Grinnell is too small for much of that to happen here, but the lack of a typical American strip of such businesses is an asset in my opinion.",We stayed because places we were interested in moving to were too expensive to afford the kind of house we were looking for. The lack of serious water supply and fire issues were other factors.,,It is difficult living in a factory. Grinnell is not big enough to avoid the continual reminder of the degradation of the environment by the dominant agricultural industry. That people accept that and even talk about how the “farmers” are working hard to provide our food is disturbing,"The lack of an ethnically diverse community, and along with that ethnically diverse dining options.

The relative paucity of local produce and meat at the grocery stores. I think that some city resources should be put towards supporting local food producers who struggle because most folks in Grinnell can’t or won’t afford to pay the prices that allow such farmers to make a living wage. I was surprised to read in the Herald Register that Grinnell actually owns 5 farms in the surrounding area that are managed by someone hired by the town - if memory serves - to support local folks who are food insecure. I wondered about how much of the production of those farms is actually human food rather than ethanol or diesel fuel or high fructose corn syrup.(It would frustrate me to find out that the management of those farms was not being done sustainably). It seems like a great opportunity for the town to support five young farm families who could work toward providing people in the town of Grinnell with  human food locally grown on small parcels of those farms.

I do a lot of walking throughout the year and I appreciate that the majority of Grinnell streets seem to have sidewalks, notably in the older parts of town, but the lack of sidewalks particularly on streets leading to some of the very nice parks in town is a real frustration, and more than that, a threat to my safety and a deterrence to other Grinnellians to get out. I can generate resentment when I’m tromping through slush in the street about the fact that I am expected to clear ice and snow from the sidewalk in front of my home, because I happen to live in a place where there is a sidewalk, while folks who have no sidewalk also have no community responsibility to maintain a passable track in front of their house. How is that fair? And while I’m at it, I find it annoying that I’m expected to keep my lawn mowed to less than 8 inches, and the City will charge me for mowing if I neglect to, but I’ve seen little effort by the City to similarly enforce a policy about maintaining a passable sidewalk - there are lots of places where shrubbery and trees present obstacles to safe passage on our sidewalks.
","Greater ethnic and cultural diversity.

Strong support for locally produced food and food processing - a community center with staff and commercially certified facilities where food growers (farmers and gardeners) could “put up” (freeze, can, etc) food in times of plenty. I’ve seen such places in rural NY.
","I’d start with my ideas above re: food. Support local growers - subsidize their food production and create facilities for food processing.
 
Then move on the sidewalk issue. First build the sidewalks in places where there are none. Since the folks that are unaccustomed to shoveling sidewalks will resent their new responsibility I think the City should purchase a fleet of electric-powered snow removal machines and hire the staff to clear all the walks in town. That might encourage more folks to get out.

","I defend Grinnell College often but it is becoming harder and harder to do so. Let’s start small, the “art installation” at the corner of hwy 6 and hwy 146 looks like baby gates or lattice around a porch. I appreciate that there isn’t a run down house or a field of weeds there but it’s very underwhelming. 
I also feel that a liberal agenda is being forced on this community. The organizations that should be encouraging patriotism struggle for participating members but I referenced that already. I guess my biggest issue is with professors teaching students how to change their residency so they can vote in local elections. Students should not be allowed to raise the taxes of Grinnell residents. I read an article in the scarlet and black regarding the past school board elections. To sum up the authors message, students need to vote because grinnell residents don’t know what’s good for them. 
The college could do more to educate students on their perception within the community. I’m not referring to alternate lifestyles or anything like that.

When they ride their bicycles on a downtown sidewalk wearing headphones and texting, they look entitled.

We’ve got a lot of ugly walls that could benefit from some artwork and not a free for all like the side of McNallys. The bowling alley had a wonderfully mural on the north wall with perfect patina.,"First of all I would fund the Grinnell Veterans Memorial Building project. The artist residency for veterans was an outstanding idea that deserved to happen. 
Next, there are far too many dilapidated homes on hwy 6 and hwy 146. It makes for a poor first impression. I think allowing outdoor storage in the Iowa Valley parking lot is in poor taste as well. I was worried that a wrecker service in city limits would look like salvage yard but they’ve kept it very nice. Rick’s could use some clean up. ","Restaurant options with the workforce to support them. Where are all the high schoolers?  Do parents just give them everything? The hotels by the interstate are always full so why can’t a restaurant make it there?
We need to stop attracting low income folks that don’t want to work. Somehow it’s a problem nationwide but the old Iowa saying “build it and they will come” can work against a community as well.

 There's some longterm issues at play here, but it's very problematic. There seems to be a resurgence in xenophobic mindsets and a fear of education in general that I find deeply concerning.  Parents thinking that teaching about racism is wrong when it is a huge problem in the district.  During 2020 and 2021, the school board race became so ugly and heated, it was really discouraging to see how that played out.  What I'm finding is that some of our most wonderful families are leaving Grinnell either because they are ""too conservative"" or ""too liberal"" and that just makes me really sad.  Many families I know personally do not feel safe in this town because of how that played out, and I frankly do not blame them.

The downward trend in high quality business and restaurants in the last 5 years has been sad to witness and makes hard to ""stay"" in Grinnell for much of anything.  I don't have any great solutions, but it seems like we need a renewed focus on this from both the chamber of commerce and community members.  

The biggest reason we've considered leaving really is related to the school system.  All of our schools need MAJOR updates and it's a problem that needs a solution.  It's sad that every time a bond has come up, it hasn't past.  To me, there is just such a lack of pride in maintaining and furthering the pillars of our school system in the form of our buildings.  We need to invest so much more into our schools.

","I know as a small business owner myself the struggle many owners face to have a profitable business in this town, and I think what is frustrating is that people seem very willing to complain about the lack-of-variety in this town, but then want franchise restaurants or chains, and won't support local small businesses or spend the money locally to do so.  

I see other small college towns (I'm thinking of Pella) that have a HUGE sense of community pride and purpose, people have things to DO in their own town, and it seems like everyone wants to do their best to be the best.  I'd love to see the same sense of town vibrancy in Grinnell. ","I think it would be great to see more community-wide events.  They are a lot of work, but also a lot of fun for everyone.

I would LOVE to see more beautiful gardens and natural spaces!

We really need more businesses and restaurants that can appeal to a more eclectic tastes.  Less pro-typical small-town-iowa (sorry, I love it, but we have enough!) and more variety!  If you talk to anyone under 30 who did not grow up in Grinnell, you'll hear again and again how there's no good place to go out to eat or nothing to do - get more insight from this crowd, because they are the ones with disposable income that will keep this town alive!  It would be lovely to have an Indian restaurant in town.  I'd love to see a true art gallery or something of the sort.  No more consignment and rummage/thrift shops please.","the vaccant lot next to the movie theater i would make into a tapas restaurant with live music and indoor-outdoor vibes.  I would love to see QUALITY live music there and delicious food, wine.  A small little stage.  That would be so cool! 

Even though I love the neighborhood schools and how it makes things walkable for a lot of kids, we really do need a unified school for the K-5 age group.  That would 100% be the top of my list.  It would be better for the teachers, for the district, and get us into the 21st century for tech, utilities, space, disability accommodations, and so much more.  It would be HUGE for our town to have ONE new K-5 school.  We honestly need a better middle school too.  It's just awful.",n/a,"I own a small business, and our family has lived in Grinnell for 14 years."

I know that now that I take care of a lady in a wheelchair, It would be nice to be able to push her around the lake instead of only halfway because I can only get her on the paved part. At Ahrens, it’s too hilly for a wheel chair but at least one or the other walking paths in town should be handicap accessible, and since Arbor lake already halfway is, someone might as will make the rest handicap accessible and leave the hills at Ahrens Park for the people that want to walk them. Makes sense to me. I’d also put a splash pad at Ahrens Park, I’d paint inspirational quotes all over the bathroom doors in all the schools. I’d paint the school bathrooms because they are all depressing and look institutionalized, I’d have awesome tiger graphics painted on the walls in the hallways, really make our schools looks awesome so that when other schools came for activities they’re like wow! Which is exactly how I felt when I went to Newton‘s new middle school a few weeks ago. What a nice school to be proud of! I would do more as a town to make it a tighter community like I would definitely have like a three day fall festival. I’ve seen other towns do it and they have awesome events. I think they’ll be a good way to bring the community together. I love the fact that you guys do music in the park in the movie on Friday nights and concerts downtown but there could be a lot more that could be done. Like right now there should be a Santa somewhere in town for people to come visit like daycare’s, Day camps and nursing homes would love to go visit a Santa. I know this probably has nothing to do with you guys but when the movie theater has the free merchant movies, they don’t do it a very convenient times. They do it on the weekends. Well I’m sure some daycare‘s and day camps and nursing homes would love to take their residents and students and clients to see a movie but they only do it on the weekends and at noon which is lunch and naptime for toddlers and elderly.

I will have to run a separate errand today to take them to Total Choice.

I'd also love for Drake to be open on Sundays and for some family/community events to take place on Sundays. As it stands, since we're a family where both parents work outside the home, we have to cram in all of our ""fun"" - events, library, etc. - into Saturday.

I'd also love to have less tension between the town and the gown. I know that the college is working on this and I'm so glad they are, so I'm hopeful that this will help. 

Bringing back the dog park would be great. I understand it was difficult for PALS to maintain itself, so absorbing it as part of the town would be good.

When my family moved back to town last year, a lot of things still require physical forms, checks, etc. to get up and running. For example, getting my dog licensed required going to town hall, you can't subscribe to the local newspaper online, etc. Modernizing services - or at least the transactional side of services - would be really nice.

Maybe there's too much attachment to the ways things were, taking it beyond a quaint marketing point.  Community is really slow to accept new people, new ideas, or change of any sort.  It's one thing to be cautious, it's another to be obstinate and obstructionist, and we often veer to the latter.  I understand that people want to respect our community and always be able to recognize it; but being unaccepting of new/different ideas or people of any sort is counterproductive to our functioning and to our image.  ","Stability.  Job. Been here over 30 years.  Inertia.  I do now think more about moving when I see Iowa (not just Grinnell) moving so politically right, and ignoring quality of life issues like education, the environment, public resources, and the experiences of the normal person (in favor of corporations). My kids will never move back here to live.  If I ever have grandchildren, I will need to go out of state to see them.",,"When the racist elements flare up  ever once in a while, that makes me think more.  Those elements are always here, but they are more recently emboldened.  Even in the police department.  That's so sad.  We're so far behind many other states in our common understanding of some difficulty and divisive issues.","The schools. Those working in the GN district are doing hard work and are thoroughly invested in our children.  They need the community to step up and match their investment. The community elements that hold back opportunities for our children by not funding a new building, and never seeing the need for any changes, are really frustrating.  We're comparing so negatively now even to neighboring districts. When a community prioritizes petty personal grievances, or a desire to stay in the past, over the well-being of our district and its ability to serve children long term, it's distressing.  We can't keep living like it's 30+ years ago; yet, some people will never allow us to move beyond that.

Then the little stuff, exacerbated by the pandemic.  Lack of access to services and service providers, on a number of levels.

I have also thought about leaving because of the large gun facility here. ","The lack of the things I mention above--Grinnell has gotten quite diminished in the last four years especially. I am frustrated by what seems to be a worn out look through town. Torn awnings downtown, temporary signs for establishments, many residential properties with lots of junk in the yards.

Local property tax payers carry a heavier load because of the millions of dollars worth of properties that the college builds and gobbles up and doesn't pay taxes on. While the college puts expensive copper on buildings and professors' families go globe trotting during all their breaks, our local school kids wonder why we have moldy, broken-down school buildings and other communities provide more support. Frequent college employee turnover at the college (partly due to financially dead end staff salaries) increase home selling prices for everyone else and means that many amazing people to come to work here end up leaving before setting down roots and contributing to community improvement. Many college professors and upper management demonize and look down local people as less than them and don't respect local expertise and experience, which is part of why local people are uncomfortable on campus. College says they care about ""social justice"" and decreasing inequities, but doesn't really understand or care about rural people and their needs even though rural communities are struggling with less resources due to dysfunctional policies and systems. Before moving here, I thought it'd be wonderful to live in a college town, but I've been seriously questioning that when I've learned more about the college's hypocrisy and elitism.","Take a look at Decorah!

It's an attractive and lively community because it's beautifully kept up in all neighborhoods, has a strong identity and activities, and a variety of businesses that contribute to the tax base and community culture.

","The lack of curbside recycling is disappointing. A few more restaurants would be nice, but I also understand that we live in a small community and that can be hard to attract and sustain. It has been difficult to find housing - I can't afford to buy a house but rental options that allow for a pet and aren't highly priced is difficult. I'm a sole earner of about $40,000 , so my options are vert limited. I did find a good place, but it look a lot of work and a lot of luck. The trash at Arbor Lake is really a shame. We have lovely parks and I don't know why some people can't clean up after themselves and take pride in our community. I find the tar chip roads in town frustrating - I live in town so I don't have to deal with roads like that. Some areas with no sidewalk and broken curbs. and why on earth are there four way intersections without stop signs? I found that very surprising when I moved here. ",More rental options (something middle of the road - not low rent but not out of reach) or condos. Curbside recycling. ,"All streets have sidewalks with nice curbing. More trees at Hazelwood Cemetery. Places to secure bikes in the downtown. Expand the GARC to include dedicated pickleball courts, an indoor soccer field, and an ice rink.

We are close to a family farmstead we own in Hardin County that was homesteaded by my great-grandfather in 1892 and which we got back by chance at an auction in 2010.  We are restoring a remnant prairie there.","Our church (St. Paul's Episcopal), the friendships of like-minded people within that congregation and throughout the city, as well as the genuine welcome we received when we moved back to town after 58 years of being other places. ","Every day when I walk downtown in the early morning, remembering the businesses that used to be there and exploring those that have replaced them, and greeting friendly people going about their day.","I still believe that Grinnell, as a whole community, has a core value toward education, which includes the college and the public school system.  When I was growing up here in the 1950s, Grinnell was highly regarded within Iowa for its school system, and I think it still is.","I have NOT considered moving from Grinnell, nor would I ever do so.  This is home.  I am nearly 81 years old and this is where I plan to stay.",,"No, see the previous answer.  If I was not so committed to Grinnell, I would give you a long list of things we need to do better, which I will do anyway!  It begins by CLEANING UP THE SOUTH ENTRANCE (WEST SIDE) TO GRINNELL,  BEGINNING WITH THE WRECKER SERVICE/U-HAUL MESS ON THE EAST SIDE OF 146.  IT LOOKS LIKE RURAL ARKANSAS","The same applies to the trashy houses and yards on West Street, just north of 6th Ave. on the west side.  You could do that by enforcing the building codes and giving the homeowner a deadline to clean it up or vacate.  Drive into Pella from any direction and see the pride they have in how their city looks.  Grinnell does NOT have that level of commitment.  ""An ounce of Image is worth a pound of performance"".  Think about that.  Also, FIX THE STREETS!  4th from 146 to the hospital; Park Street from 10th to the golf course;  Country Club Drive and Manor Drive, Broad Street and Main Street from 11th down to 6th: Summer street and most others.  Who wants to move to a town with high property taxes and streets in need of repair? ","It is missing tax incentives to attract REAL businesses, not just fast food and minimum wage places.  Who has replaced Miracle Equipment, DeLong, GTE and others?  Nobody.  I think the Chamber needs to create a real marketing program to recruit and attract these kinds of businesses.  The city has depended for too long on Grinnell College and Grinnell Mutual to maintain a status quo, rather than create a better tax base.  Also, re-evaluate the building codes and inspection precesses to make it easier to say ""yes"" to entrepreneurs, rather than nickel and dime small businesses trying to start up (like Maria's) with petty regulations and power plays that cost money and loyalty (like you did to Maria's).  That is racist and unacceptable.  ","It is not so much unlimited funds as it is limited will and limited vision, plus a lack of political courage.  Remove the impediments to dismantling the scaffolding on the west side of Broad Street between 4th and 5th.  That has been up since before we moved back and there is no need to continue this litigation to languish.  Step up, solve it and move on.  It is a blight on the entire downtown, and it makes Grinnell look trashy","I live here, so I have a vested interest in the improvements I have just stated.   The sign on I-80 says ""Grinnell has 30+ restaurants"", but that's not true.  Give a tax incentive to someone to re-open the Depot and upgrade the kitchen, so that it is functional, safe and profitable.  That would be a real restaurant.  Don't depend on realtors to get that moving - form a partnership with the Chamber, recruit Des Moines chefs (or Iowa City or out of state), but be proactive.  Closed business that languish in a community fester and make us embarrassed to see that,  Political Courage - the ultimate oxymoron.","My family moved to Grinnell in 1954 with GTE and I graduated from GHS with the class of 1960.  It was a very formative time in my life and as a teenager I worked at Logsdon Shell station, Matthews Drug, Cunningham Drug, Iowa Cleaners and Smith Funeral Home, so I got to know a lot of people.  I always considered it my hometown.  I was encouraged to take the survey by friends at St. Paul's. Episcopal Church, where we have been members since our return to Grinnell in 2020."

I will never forget the school board meeting where local doctors (not Fauci!) talked very calmly and rationally about masks and vaccines and community members who had had COVID revealed just how bad it could get. And the response by much of the community was disbelief, denial, and intense anger. That was one of the most demoralizing moments in my entire time in Grinnell.

","I've not considered moving because I think we are so lucky to have our retirement communities and opportunities here.  Grinnell is in an outstanding location in the state,  I 80 is close by, because of its size it's safe to live in, it's easy to drive in,  the churches are an important part of the community,  the college adds a lot to the atmosphere and available entertainment.",,Our Chamber of Commerce seems lacking in initiative and I've noted a feeling of frustration among  the downtown business community.,"No longer having The Depot restaurant!!
The college no longer requiring their faculty to live in Grinnell.  When they live elsewhere and commute to work here, their children are no longer in our school district (which they enriched socially and via numbers), the families are elsewhere, so they are not supporting our local businesses ( which affects our local economy - both in keeping viable and in the variety of businesses that are available),  they are not mingling with local residents which widens the gap between town and gown and eliminates a common interest in the community.  Moving a dormitory downtown does not correct those problems.
","Car license station in Grinnell - it makes no  sense to have it in Montezuma when the population is centered  in  Grinnell --  Plus  the population of Mayflower and Seeland Park,  often don't even know where Montezuma is!  We have a large elder population and many drive only locally.  There is a space for it at our city offices and it should be here.

The Depot Restaurant is greatly missed !

A local ambulance service that would  also be used by Unity Point.  It is ludicrous to have a UP ambulance be summoned from Marshalltown to transport  patients from Unity Point Hospital in Grinnell...to one of the local nursing homes (coming 35 miles to transport a patient maybe 2 miles...and then return to Marshalltown, 35 miles.)  It's unconscionable to waste the gas, pollute the environment, and inconvenience patients.  

Real recycling program.  Other towns our size continue to do so...why don't we??  ""Saving money"" is important...but so is being a responsible community and saving our environment.  Bring in an industry that recycles materials. into something new.   Have curbside recycling pickup.  A lot of our senior citizens want to recycle but have no way nor  physical ability to take their recycles to the depository on 1st avenue.

We need  to make all citizens feel they are a part of our community and able to do something FOR our community.  Active, involved citizens are happy people and the community benefits.

275,"  I love that the Fine Arts are set as a priority. The Arts Council specifically has done a great job with community involvement in terms of plays, kid opportunities, art showcases, and more. 
    I also am so glad to live in Grinnell in the summertime. The community of Grinnell in the summer is so strong and enjoyable to be around. Music in the Park, Farmers Market, Summerfest (which unfortunately hasn’t been going on since before covid), and outdoor restaurant seating areas are just a few of my favorite aspects about Grinnell in the summer. 
   Friendliness is also very prominent in this town. Local grocery stores, such as McNallys, restaurants, such as Jays Deli and Prairie Canary, and shops, such as Saints Rest or Anna Kaytes, always have a welcoming presence. ","The nostalgia of Grinnell as my hometown is always present. I travel fairly often, but I am always excited by the end of my trip to come back to Grinnell. This town continues traditions that have been going on for years that always bring back childhood memories for me, such as Art Camp, the Too Many String Band at Saints Rest, and Jingle Bell Holiday, to name a few.","In 2016, I was asked to be in the film called “Saints Rest” directed by Noga Ashkenazi, a former Grinnell College alumni. The film highlighted all of the aspects about Grinnell life that I adore. Music, community, friendliness, activities, and quaintness are all major elements positively described to be associated with Grinnell. I was an extra in the Community Choir (a choir just for the film) and it made me feel so proud to be representing Grinnell in such a wonderful way.","I think Grinnell as a community represents friendliness. Many people here smile at strangers on the street, engage in conversation with friends of a friend of a friend, and even help out random community members out of sheer kindness. ","I have never considered moving away from Grinnell, even for college. Next year, I plan to begin my first college years at Grinnell College, mainly because this town is where I wish to continue living. My entire family lives here, I feel at home, this town continues to keep the traditions alive, and I love the small-town friendly feeling when I walk downtown.",,"Although I haven’t seriously considered leaving Grinnell, there have been some things that I wish could be different. For example, there are not as many opportunities or options here as there are in other, oftentimes bigger, towns. There aren’t any fancy restaurants, picturesque flower or nature areas, or hangout places besides bars/restaurants.","   There is not much of a cuisine variety in Grinnell. The restaurants downtown all have fairly similar menus, besides 2 Mexican restaurants and 1 Chinese restaurant, which is takeout only. 
   When I hangout with my friends, there are very few options to do/go to. Hotel Grinnell is the only real game place where we can hangout at, but even then, that’s not really its intended purpose. At one point, there was a roller skating rink with games, but it wasn’t very well set up and it went away within a year. 
   Rock Creek would be an awesome hangout spot for friends in the summer, but the water toxic and is not safe to swim in and the beach is tiny and dirty. I’m not sure if this would be a problem that this project would deal with, but it is something that I think needs improvement.
   The Grinnell College Golf Course pool use to be my favorite place to go with my family and friends in the summer. Even though there is a City Waterpark/Pool, it is incredibly different compared to the vibe at the Golf Course pool. I like the quaintness and simplicity of the Golf Course pool and it is the perfect place to enjoy a sunbathing and relaxing day with some friends. Many people in the community I have talked with would be strong advocates in the return of the Gold Course pool.

In other words, a large park that encompasses the entire town, with areas that would provide habitat for more wildlife, walking and bike paths, play areas, picnic areas, etc. Some sort of safer bike connections between the existing parks would be wonderful. It's really great that there is now a bike path all the way to Rock Creek State Park, and also one that goes under Hwy Six and by the water park.
","See above. Also, in dreaming really big, it would be amazing to turn at least part of the downtown into a version of an old English arcade - with an ironwork and glass ceiling covering a street.

Their ""freedom"" to not wear a mask meant more than keeping vulnerable community members safe. Another tough moment was a school board meeting in the midst of the uprisings following the killing of George Floyd. Again, a critical mass of Grinnell community members seemed not to care at all that some kids of color were experiencing racism in the schools.

We like eating at diverse restaurants, they just keep closing. We would like lessons and extracurricular opportunities for our kids, but other than sports, there doesn’t seem to be much available. My kids are not interested in sports. The politics of the state of Iowa, the Christian conservatism, the increasingly right wing government is really worrying and I have frequently fantasized about moving to a blue state. The schools here lack diversity and staff that are trained or knowledgeable in issues of diversity / inclusion or how to protect vulnerable kids. There has been a lot of homophobia and racism at the middle school that has for years, gone unaddressed. Colleagues from the college have moved to Iowa city or Des Moines for more opportunity and diversity. As the state of Iowa panders to right wing extremism, the ability of teachers and administrators to deal with issues of inclusion will only get harder.","See my above comment about lack of access to ethnic restaurants, diversity of opportunities for kids extracurricular be on sports, lack of diversity in general, and lack of attention to creative curricular adjustments or empirically-based pedagogical teaching methods at my kids schools. The schools often seem like a big time waste meant to keep kids busy .","Again, more ethnic restaurants, opportunities for different kinds of music lessons and live music beyond bluegrass and praise bands, more diversity, and better dialogue between the community and the college.

The grocery stores are consistently discontinuing vegan and vegetarian food items, so we find that we are increasingly limited and what we can prepare at home, and then our opportunities for takeout are extremely limited when we are in a bind and need to order out, that gets really boring and starts to feel limiting, And because it is largely due to economics based on cultural preferences of white working class Iowans, there’s no incentive for businesses to diversify their offerings.

Our school buildings are in a very sad state, and then when you compare them to those around us you see how bad they truly are. I just don’t understand how a community our size with the colleges in this town that we have, have yet to figure out that we need to improve our school buildings. Our kids deserve better. ","I would renovate the schools, making them more sustainable and to make them make sense for our size. I would widen and fix all of our streets, which are in disrepair. I would put the pretty street lights that go down 146 and around town all over town to add charm. I would add biking and walking paths that connect from and completely through town and hook up all the way to the Baxter Trail. 
I would build a bigger version of the Ahrens facility or add onto it, to include more court space, seating, indoor soccer fields, batting cages, etc similar to Rec Plex so that we could host a wide variety of tournaments year round.

There is a decent variety of shops and restaurants, as well as opportunities to interact with the community through parks and rec, theater and arts, school events, and events at the college. The schools are pretty good and I like what Dr. Stutz is doing. There is a relatively low rate of serious crime.","The college, the Ahrens foundation, and the chamber. The college provides a lot of jobs, contributes to the local economy, support local organizations with grants and other funding, and brings a lot of  free activities to the community that a small town wouldn't normally have access to. The Ahrens foundation does great work to improve the community, support those in need, and provide other resources. The chamber also provides a lot of great activities to the community that bring residents together while championing local businesses, and supports business with networking and other resources.","I like walking into Saints Rest and they all know what my usual order is, or knowing all the staff at the local restaurants. I like seeing familiar faces at the grocery store, or at the park. I was particularly proud of the response by the city, the chamber, the ministerial association, the police, and the college to the recent racist activities around town and on the campus. There are people here that are unwilling to accept such toxic behaviors and attitudes in our community and are willing to stand up to it. ","Not a unified set. There is definitely a divide in the community thanks to politics, town vs. gown, and racism. We see it in the schools, on the streets, in the businesses. There are very different ideas of what safe, welcoming, and connected looks like. And very different ideas about what a fair and good education looks like. ","The politics, particularly in the school system and the school board. The pandemic brought out some very ugly and ignorant sides to the community, and the lack of regard for other people (especially those that are different) was really evident. I stayed because 1) my job is here, 2) my extended family is here, and 3) running away won't make these issues better and 4) there are still some really great people and organizations here that are making a difference.",,The politics of the school board.

Another frustration I experience is the seemingly lack of pride some homeowners appear to take in their homes.  There are so many beautiful older homes in Grinnell, but often the homes are not cared for, weeds are taking over, and yards are filled with junk/debris.  I don’t really know if the issue is lack of pride and caring, money, or too many rentals…but it’s sad to me, and an eyesore to the community.","An identity aside from Grinnell College.  For example… Pella has its Dutch identity and annual Tulip Festival… with supporting businesses such as the dutch bakeries.  What is Grinnell’s identity…Jewelbox of the Prairie?  I’m not sure outsiders understand, nor are drawn to this.  What can be done to expand on this?

What would make people want to come to Grinnell…to shop, eat, enjoy its charm?  How does Grinnell become a destination community?","Invest in beautification of the community, the homes, the parks, and businesses that would draw people here.  

Businesses at the I80 interchange…Target, Applebees, Home Depot, Menards or Lowe’s, Aldi…the types of businesses that people currently drive to Des Moines or Iowa City to access.

Improve upon the appearance of 146 when entering from the interstate… using trees, sidewalks, bike paths, fences, etc.  For example, fence around the wrecked cars at the towing/Uhaul business and spruce up the look of the hotels.

Establish a Botanical Center/ Arboretum focusing on native plants and how to grow your own food.  Update/improve our local parks.  Build a minature golf course.  

Update the middle school.  Improve the appearance of Hwy 6 on the west side of Grinnell.  

Bring in another coffee shop…such as Smokey Row out of Osky.

443,"I perceive Grinnell to be safe (I understand this is relative), and I value safety greatly.
Diversity. Again, this is relative, but, largely due to Grinnell College’s presence, we enjoy diversity that is unusual for a community of this size.
There are many family-friendly opportunities and opportunities for established and older adults.
Having the hospital right here within the city is a huge strength. Family practice options seem adequate, as well, especially when combined with the access to visiting specialists through Unity Point.
I appreciate knowing so many people in the city and making connections with more and more people through those I already know.
The friendly businesses, especially restaurants, are very important to me.
","Health care access (as mentioned in #1) is huge for me.
Having St. Mary’s Catholic Church right in town is so important to us.
Businesses (especially restaurants and grocery stores), the services provided by the city, and free-and-open-to-the-public events sponsored by Grinnell College and various community organizations make a big impact.
The variety of options for living environments (including long-term care) as we age and what I perceive to be a vibrant post-retirement community are appealing. I feel safe and comfortable, looking ahead to that stage of my life in Grinnell.
The GARC was a precious resource as we raised our son, and we treasure the multiple parks in town and the bike trail.","This is not very specific, but we felt particularly connected to Grinnell during the years that we were raising our son. We took advantage of so many different resources and opportunities that the community offers. As empty nesters, our connections are different and a bit narrower, but we still feel a very strong connection to our community. One of our greatest simple pleasures is driving through all the neighborhoods and observing life being lived and chatting about our memories and experiences of this house or that street or this store or that family.","There are obviously exceptions, but my current perception is that Grinnell overall values family, kindness, safety, and acceptance.","We only briefly considered moving from Grinnell once, twenty-some years ago, and it would have been for my husband’s employment opportunity. We were not willing to give up all that Grinnell offered, and my husband turned down that job offer.",,We have had no thought of leaving Grinnell since that job offer my husband had elsewhere twenty-some years ago.,"At times, and in certain domains of our community’s life, it has felt as though Grinnell College has had too much influence, pushing an agenda that may not accurately represent the values of many living in the community. However, I am simultaneously aware of the incredibly positive force that Grinnell College is in our community and the countless ways we all benefit from the institution’s presence and generosity.
The repeated failures to pass a bond issue mean that students and educators are attempting to function in school facilities that do not adequately meet our safety or education needs. It is my perception that our schools no longer enjoy the kind of reputation that attracts individuals who are seeking employment in education. 
As a person who is truly terrified of dogs, it frustrates me that people do not obey the leash ordinance in town. On a given day, my husband and I typically encounter at least one or two loose dogs on our walk; he runs interference for me, but it leaves me feeling unsafe to go for a walk when he is not available.","It seems that Grinnell lacks social opportunities for the teenage and young adult populations which, in my perception, leads to many young people leaving the area after high school to settle in places that cater to their social needs. It is high praise for Grinnell that a good number of these people return to Grinnell when it is time to raise a family - they recognize how much the community has to offer young families. ","I would want to see more restaurants, both in town and perhaps some recognized franchise restaurants close to the Interstate, as well as serious improvements to the water system. It would be amazing to have more of our streets in good condition, especially within neighborhoods. The bike trail is quite nice, but we must pedal through bone-jarringly rough roads in order to access the trail.
Pouring additional funding into the schools could help the Grinnell-Newburg school district again become a selling point for families considering moving to or staying in Grinnell. The physical facilities are an obvious need, but, even beyond that, having to meet more and more mandates with less and less government funding (not even keeping up with the rate of inflation) has had a negative impact on our district.",,"I am writing this as an individual.

I feel like even though Grinnell as a whole and the College community get along well enough, I am not sure there is a core set of values that captures both.

I have a sense of the college but not always of the town. This may be largely due to my having been in the pandemic for the majority of my time here. Grinnell balances the core values associated with small, rural, close knit communities. But it also has influences from the cosmopolitan and international influences that come into the community. It also has a small contingent of people that are frighteningly reactionary, telling international or POC students to keep their heads down, heckling them in the street, and telling them to go back where they came from. This has been scary for them and disheartening to me as a POC. I also worry, based on what students share that they experience the college's attunement to certain minority groups out weighs their care or concern for others. While some of these exist in greater balance, the same balances do not play out in every situation. The recent attachs on people of color disturb me greatly and while I think there have been some efforts, there need to be more.  ","My situation is precarious in that I've been on year-long contracts, the absence of certainty is incredibly hard. I find myself wanting to stay for the students and for my early career colleague friendships. This may not happenbut at times when the attractions of larger places call me, it is the connections and dedication that my other colleagues point out are most worth sharing.

The inquiry was to verify that he was indeed, our son. This associate (whom we have not spoken to at length for many years) wanted to praise our son and his parents after witnessing a positive interaction between he and his friends. There is an old adage that goes, to paraphrase, ""do right even when no one is watching"". On this occasion, my son did right when he thought no one was watching.

As well, there seems to be a push from the college for students to be active in local government. As the law is written, that is their right and I support the free exercise thereof. However, the college is not a neutral zone. It is treated as an impenetrable fortress, both from within and from without, resistant and even hostile to the community acting within its borders.

The college is strange in the sense that it purports itself as being incredibly open-minded and accepting; yet, in my experience, if anybody shares a thought/opinion that is counter to the dominant (typically politically-left) belief, that person is criticized and firmly shut out of the conversation without any room for casual/open-minded discourse. There is a place for this when opinions are dangerous/potentially harmful, but the vast majority of the time I've witnessed this occur, this is not the case. So Grinnell's ""core value"" of ""inclusivity"" and ""discourse"" is really a value of only including like-minded thinkers and only engaging in soft discourse, not with radically differing perspectives. This causes a huge divide between the campus and surrounding community, as I've found the town of Grinnell is incredibly willing to engage in discourse and is very open-minded, but the campus community (mostly students) views the town as radically different and therefore dangerous, making it difficult to form a positive relationship between the two",N/A,,N/A,My frustrations lie mostly with the campus community.

Students need to be disciplined instead of slapped on the wrist or coddled. We should learn to act like adults, not entitled children. If common areas are damaged/dirtied, community fines are ineffective, the individual needs to be held responsible. The campus community also needs to think critically about security issues. Side walks throughout campus are super dark. Students have access to every dorm building, not just their own. There are minimal cameras in academic buildings. Security is incredibly lacking on campus which is contributing to the lack of accountability within the student population.

The broader community could also improve nighttime lighting conditions in many areas. My hometown (similar size to Grinnell) installed a speaker system on the main downtown streets that play music throughout the day- this turned out to be a very nice touch that really completed the atmosphere of the community. Perhaps holding more community events (like Kites over Grinnell) would be beneficial as those are some of my favorite times of the year for bringing the campus and broader community together. Also, publicizing these events as I spoke to some students who had no idea Kites over Grinnell happened until after it was over. Coordinating with the college to advertise might be of consideration.

The highway right by campus is also very hard to cross if you wait for the signal, since it's so long. It could also do with a sound that the button has been successfully pushed, to give confirmation for such a long light and to support those deaf or hard of hearing.","The above-described sidewalk/pedestrian infrastructure improvements.

Although I did make friends with some kids in town who are college age, seeing them around or in the brewhouse is always a pleasure. Seeing my French advisor work in a community garden was nice too. ","I think it depends on which community you’re talking about. The values of the college and its students don’t always line up with those of Grinnell citizens. Not just politically, but in terms of connection and goals, obviously those from the town are more involved in town affairs, students tend to stay mostly on campus. Students are only here for four years so we tend to focus on what the town has to offer for us, and not what we can do to help the town long term, since most of us aren’t here long term. ",N/A ,,Not particularly,"As a student without a car, Grinnell is not a very walkable town. The downtown area is of course but to get to Walmart, Hyvee, or even Fareway is pretty difficult for students, especially in the winter. The college shuttle helps with this.","I think that better advertisement for community events would be welcome to invite college students into town more. I think this problem is connected with the college too, there isn’t really a good central space for posters or advertisements to be placed. The JRC stairway would be perfect, especially for students waiting in D Hall lines, but for some reason posters aren’t allowed to be posted there. 

Affordable grocery store (looking at you McNallys) or even a Walgreens/CVS type establishment near the downtown area. 

Maybe niche but I would love an Indian restaurant, and I think the large amount of Indian students would support the business as well. 

A restaurant or diner open late would be really nice but I am not sure how much business they would get outside of weekends. 


","PAY D HALL WORKERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (especially permanent staff). D hall has deteriorated so much after Covid. It’s almost insulting considering that what we are charged for dining hall would let you eat at Prairie Canary for every meal

Some sort of high-school style announcements would really improve engagement in my opinion. This could include in-town events too, if members of the community were given allowed time to speak as well

 Make student resources more easily accessible or streamlined, the decentralized and confusing services are kind of hard to navigate

More classes in Steiner, Goodnow, and Mears cottages. The older buildings have so much character that the HSSC lacks 

Reopen Lyles Pub

laundry machines in all the dorms

air conditioning in north and south campus 

end daylight savings time so it doesn’t get dark so early 

let us use the hot tub in the natatorium it’s always closed for some reason

Maybe some more landscaping, sculptures, or prairie development in parts of Mac Field that aren’t used for recreation

I love the architecture of Burling but the space itself isn’t ideal. There isn’t really enough study space and the walk to Burling from North or East campus in the winter is brutal, especially if a study session ends up going a little late. Once again maybe idealistic but another smaller library on the unused part of Mac Field (east of the sidewalk dividing east) would be super convenient.
